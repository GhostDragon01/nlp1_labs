# NLP Tasks Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive overview of several Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, ranging from fundamental techniques to advanced Transformer models. The work is a collaborative effort between myself and two classmates, culminating in a series of seven lab exercises focused on NLP. Detailed descriptions of each lab are provided below. The corresponding code is accessible via the provided GitHub link.

## Labs Description

1. **Naive Bayes Classifier for Sentiment Analysis**
   - **Dataset**: IMDB Dataset
   - **Description**: Implementation of a custom Naive Bayes Classifier and its comparison with the Scikit-Learn version. Enhancements include lemmatization and stemming.

2. **Logistic Regression Classifier for Sentiment Analysis**
   - **Dataset**: IMDB Dataset
   - **Description**: Development of a Logistic Regression Classifier using PyTorch, compared against Scikit-Learn’s version. Feature generation techniques include Pandas, Numpy (vectorized), and PySpark.

3. **Classification with FastText and GloVe**
   - **Dataset**: IMDB Dataset
   - **Description**: Use of FastText and GloVe embeddings for feature generation in a classification task.

4. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Implementation**
   - **Dataset**: IMDB Dataset
   - **Description**: Creation of a custom RNN and comparison with PyTorch-based RNN, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) models.

5. **Transformer Model for Language Translation**
   - **Dataset**: Multi30k
   - **Description**: Implementation of a Transformer model for English to German translation, following a PyTorch tutorial. The BLEU score is used to evaluate model accuracy.

6. **Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT**
   - **Dataset**: IMDB Dataset
   - **Description**: Application of transfer learning using the DistilBERT model, a compact variant of BERT, for sentiment analysis.

7. **Theoretical Focus: Model Evaluation and Data Annotation**
   - **Dataset**: 'tweet_eval/offensive'
   - **Description**: Exploration of model evaluation and data annotation techniques, employing the Roberta model.
