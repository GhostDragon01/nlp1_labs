## Description of the project

This lab focuses on the use and understanding of dense word vectors. First you will use GloVe, which is very similar to word2vec, to train a sentiment classifier. Then you'll use the FastText library for the same purpose.

## Project architecture

Our work can be found in the 2 notebooks named : 'fill_your_own_glove.ipynb' and 'FastText.ipynb'
