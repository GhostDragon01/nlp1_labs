### Presentation

In this notebook, we took the 'imdb' dataset from HuggingFace, we applied preprocessing to format the text ( lowercase the text and remove punctuation).
Then we implemented our own Naives Bayes estimator to predict the sentiment (negative or positive) on a new dataset.
We then used the sklearn library to implement the naive bayes classifier.
We then compared the accuracy of the 2 implementations.
Finally we applied the lemmatization on the text before training our model and we reproduced predictions
