## Introduction

This lab focuses on RNNs. We will code our own RNN before using the implementation provided by pyTorch. The aim of this lab is to understand the data structure and be confortable applying it on a simple problem, we thus still use the IMDB dataset.

## Project architecture

Our work can be found in the 2 notebooks named : `01 code your own RNN.ipynb` and `02 using pyTorch RNNs.ipynb`
