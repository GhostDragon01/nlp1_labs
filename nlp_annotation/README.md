## Dataset and annotation

This lab is mainly about data and model analysis.
It's also about annotating a dataset of tweets to detect offensive tweets and analyze the results to understand the difficulty of the task and the bias the model may have by classifying tweets as offensive or not offensive.

The notebook is divided in 3 parts :
- Data analysis
- Model analysis
- Annotation analysis

The dataset used for annotation is composed of 100 tweets. Each tweet has been annotated by us separately. The annotation guideline can be found in the notebbok and is also in the file named `annotation_guideline.pdf`. 

## Project architecture

Our work can be found in the notebook named : `nlp_annotation.ipynb`

The annotation sheet is in the file `offensive_tweets_annotated.xlsx`.
